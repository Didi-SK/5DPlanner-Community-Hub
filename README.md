# Planner5D Community Hub  
**Trello meets Figma — built exclusively for Planner5D power users**

### The Problem We’re Solving  
Interior designers, architects, and realtors use Planner5D daily to create stunning 3D designs…  
…but they work in isolation.

- No shared workspace  
- No version history  
- No client feedback loop  
- No way to hand off projects between team members  
- Files get lost in email threads and WhatsApp

### Who This Is For  
- **Interior Designers** running studios  
- **Architects** collaborating on commercial projects  
- **Realtors** creating virtual staging for listings  
- **Design teams** tired of “send me the latest .p5d file”

### What It Does (MVP – Live in 21 days)  
1. **Team Boards** – Drag-and-drop project stages (Brief → Concept → Client Review → Final)  
2. **Real-time Co-editing** – Multiple people in the same Planner5D file simultaneously  
3. **Live Client Approval** – Clients click “Approve” directly on the board  
4. **Version History** – Every save creates a restore point  
5. **Direct Export** – One-click to Planner5D, PDF, or 360° tour  
6. **Comment Threads** – Pin feedback directly on furniture items
